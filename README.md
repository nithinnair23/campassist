Campassist Bot is a ChatBot that will be designed to tackle the said problem statement, It is a modern method to introduce freshers and guests to a College Campus. As this is an education project, I have planned to create project to guide users through an imaginary College Campus.
The Chatbot will be made using the QnA Service of Azure and will use a knowledge base created specifically to answer questions and all possible permutations of a set of questions.
The Chatbot will then be deployed onto a static website that I will host using GitHub pages online.
